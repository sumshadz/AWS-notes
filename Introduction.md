# Introduction to cloud computing

## What is cloud computing?

It is on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can use technology services such as computing power, storage, and database.
e.g. Google Drive. We get storage over Internet and pay for it.

## Cloud service providers
AWS, Microsoft Azure & Google Cloud Platform
## Cloud computing models
**Public cloud**: They are owned and operated by 3rd party cloud service providers, which deliver their computing resources like storage and server over the internet. For example, many customers are using storage from these service providers then all of their data will be stored in a common data center. So resources are provided to customers and not exclusive to all customers.
e.g. AWS, Microsoft Azure & Google Cloud Platform

**Private cloud**: Cloud computing resources used exclusively by single businesses or organizations. A private cloud can be physically located in the company's onsite data centers. For example, you are renting 10 servers, so there will be dedicated servers for your company only, only your company's server can run, and no one else will be sharing that.
A private cloud can also be set up by public cloud service providers like AWS-VPC.

**Hybrid cloud**: Hybrid cloud combines public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them.
For example, you are building an application and you want to store your frontend code in the public cloud so that it is visible to everyone, and your database and backend code in a private cloud, in such case you can use a hybrid cloud.
## Cloud Computing Services
**Software as a service (SaaS)**: Providing software over the internet. 
e.g. google drive, gmail, etc.

**Platform as a service (PaaS)**: Provides a platform where you can upload your code and it will automatically host your website. Application development and deployment.
e.g. AWS elastic benstalk.

**Infrastructure as a Service**: Server, storage, and operating system. 
e.g. AWS S3, AWS EC2, etc.
