## What is EC2 ? 
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.
- It allows users to launch and manage virtual servers, known as instances.
- Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster.
- The virtual computing servers are known as Instances in EC2
- An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a template that contains a software configuration (for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications). From an AMI, you launch an instance, which is a copy of the AMI running as a virtual server in the cloud.
- The root device for your instance contains the image used to boot the instance. The root device is either an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or an instance store volume.
- When you launch an instance, the instance type that you specify determines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance. Each instance type offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities, and is grouped in an instance family based on these capabilities.
- Amazon EC2 provides each instance with a consistent and predictable amount of CPU capacity, regardless of its underlying hardware.
